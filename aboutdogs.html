My dogs<br>
<img src="dogs.JPG">
<br> These are my two dogs, Zoey and Coco!
<br> Zoey (picture right) was my first dog, I got her over eleven years ago.
<br> Alough Zoey is very old, she is still full of love and energy.
<br> Coco (picture left) came a few years later. She was rescued five years ago, so we don't know her real age.
<br> Coco has epilepsy and a hypothyroid condition, but it's easy to forget about that because she is so cute.
