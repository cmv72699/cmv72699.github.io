<br>
I am a brother of Phi Kappa Sigma at the University of Maine.
<br>
I believe that joining a fraternity was one of the best things I could have done for myself as a freshman.
<br>
I immediately made multiple strong friendships within the first few days of joining.
<br>
The resources that my fraternity has offered me have made me a better student and person.
